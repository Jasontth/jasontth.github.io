      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Blockchain technology was first notably used in Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The technology enables Bitcoin to create a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, allowing online payments to take place without a third-party institution (Nakamoto, 2008). The application of blockchain is not constrained to cryptocurrency, it can also be used to store information and data. The use of blockchain technology is becoming more and more popular. Not only are people starting to apply them to cryptocurrencies, but also for sustainability and social justice. Blockchain technology is inherently decentralized, anonymous and immutable, unlike traditional centralized and bureaucratic approaches. It omits the requirement of having to trust a third-party organization, the verification of transactions is done automatically through consensus algorithms. The technology represents a "transition from trusting people to trusting mathematics" where people no longer need to trust any third parties but instead the system (Antonopoulos, 2014). This creates a fair and equal environment with increased transparency and greatly reduced fraud and corruption. This article covers the application of blockchain, examples of ‘blockchain for good’ projects, and how they can be beneficial to society.      </p>
