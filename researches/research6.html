    <h2>Machine Learning Approaches for Bitcoin Address Classification: A Comprehensive Review and Dataset</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        The recent crises and bubble bursts in the crypto market, such as the Terra incident and the collapse of FTX, have raised concerns among government entities and investors. To increase transparency and monitor on-chain activities, reliable methods are needed to identify illegal transactions. Machine learning techniques can serve as valuable tools for classifying addresses and detecting illicit on-chain activities. This paper focuses on Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, and aims to provide a comprehensive review of the feasibility of using machine learning classification methods for labeling Bitcoin addresses. Additionally, we present a publicly available dataset for address labeling by scraping data from Blockchain.com. The dataset includes 15,355 labeled Bitcoin addresses, as well as labels for Tokens, ETH, and BCH addresses. These resources are made available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/Jasontth/crypto_label">https://github.com/Jasontth/crypto_label</a>) to facilitate research and enable the training of classification models in this domain.
