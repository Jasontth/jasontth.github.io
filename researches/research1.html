    <h2>Incrementalism in Policy Formulation - A Case Study of London Basement Policy</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        The way of policy formulation has sparked a fierce debate in the post-war period. While comprehensive rationality is regarded as the ideal model of decision making, incrementalist argues the unrealistic side of it, and policymakers should not attempt to reach this ideal (Cairney, 2011). The model of Incrementalism was coined by Lindblom (1963) and is often described as a muddling process in policy formulation. It is to make small adjustments towards the feedback of previous decisions but lacks overriding and clear-cut goals. Therefore, decisions are made under the existing framework and take place through a series of steps (Heywood, 2019). This essay argues how incrementalism has provided a more realistic model than comprehensive rationality by illustrating the domination of incrementalism in the policy formulation process with an example of the London basement policy.
